- **Replaced default Expo intro with a custom HomeScreen UI**
- HomeScreen is now in `components/HomeScreen.jsx` and imported by `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- **Top nav**: Large "TrailMate" title, optional subtitle, and hamburger menu icon (currently non-functional)

### [2024-06-10] - Rescue Request Navigation & Form Flow

- **Implemented full navigation and form flow for Rescue Request:**
  - Tapping the big red "Need Rescue" button on HomeScreen now opens a dedicated RescueForm modal screen.
  - Modal navigation is handled via Expo Router and React Navigation (root stack, not a tab).
- **HomeScreen:**
  - "Need Rescue" button now navigates to RescueForm modal (removed old local modal logic).
- **RescueForm screen:**
  - UI matches Figma wireframe 1:1 (location, issue type, photo upload, details, submit, SMS info).
  - Auto-fills current GPS location (Expo Location).
  - Four issue type buttons (Stuck in mud, Flat tire, Mechanical, Snow/ice).
  - Optional photo upload (Expo Image Picker). If image picker is not available, UI shows a camera emoji and a message; uploading images is NOT implemented in that case.
  - Additional details (120 char max, live count).
  - "Confirm & Broadcast" button validates and submits.
- **Form logic:**
  - Validates required fields (location, issue type).
  - Uploads photo to Firebase Storage if provided and image picker is available. If not, image upload is NOT implemented.
  - Saves rescue request to Firestore with correct schema and current user's UID.
  - On success, routes back to HomeScreen.
- **Code style:**
  - Modular, clean, and uses inline styles for maintainability.

### [2024-06-10] - Firebase Storage Photo Upload

- **Implemented Firebase Storage for photo uploads:**
  - Photos are uploaded to Firebase Storage in the `rescues/` folder.
  - File naming: `{userUID}_{timestamp}.{extension}` for uniqueness.
  - Photos are converted to blob and uploaded before saving to Firestore.
  - Download URL is stored in Firestore for later retrieval.
  - Proper camera and photo library permissions are requested before accessing device media.
  - Graceful fallback if image picker is not available (shows emoji and message).

  - Display rescue requests that have been uploaded to Firestore.
  - Show real-time updates when new requests are added.
  - List view with request details (location, issue type, timestamp, status).
  - Filter by status (pending, accepted, completed).
  - Integration with existing HomeScreen to show active requests count.
- **Completed feature to view active rescue requests:**
  - Created ActiveRequests screen with real-time Firestore integration.
  - Displays rescue requests with details (location, issue type, timestamp, status, photo indicator).
  - Filter tabs for All, Pending, Accepted, Completed statuses.
  - Real-time updates using Firestore onSnapshot listener.
